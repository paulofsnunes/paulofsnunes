### Hello, my name is Paulo!
<p align="left">
<strong>Front-end Developer</strong>, passionate about technology and creating innovative solutions for real-world problems. I have experience in various programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools, such as <strong>JavaScript, React, Vue, Nuxt, Next, Tailwind CSS, SCSS, among others</strong>. Additionally, I possess leadership, communication, teamwork, and continuous learning skills. I have participated in several challenging and high-impact projects throughout my career.

I graduated in Law from PUCRS in 2013, where I always worked with goals, deadlines, high demand, and direct client contact, demonstrating efficiency and positive results. However, Law was not exactly where I fit in. I have always shown ease in the IT field, as computer science is very intuitive to me. It was in the course of 2020 that I fell in love with the programming field, especially in web development, making my career transition and completing the Bachelor's Degree in Systems Analysis and Development at Univali.

I am constantly improving myself, taking courses, and participating in bootcamps with a focus on front-end development, a passion of mine!
